    "So far, we’ve used Python to explore and manipulate individual datasets by hand, much like we would do in a spreadsheet. The beauty of using a programming language like Python, though, comes from the ability to automate data processing through the use of loops and functions.\n",

    "Suppose now that we would like to calculate the average GDP per capita, its median and standard deviation for all continents over all the years. We could write specific conditions for each case, and write the same code over again for the different situation but that would be time consuming, error prone and hard to maintain. A more elegant solution would be to create a **reusable tool** that performs this task with minimum input from the user. To do this, we are going to turn the code we’ve already written into a **function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are reusable, self-contained pieces of code that are called with a single command. They can be designed to accept arguments as input and return values, but they don’t need to do either. Variables declared inside functions only exist while the function is running and if a variable within the function (a local variable) has the same name as a variable somewhere else in the code, the local variable hides but doesn’t overwrite the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every method used in Python (for example, **`print()`**) is a function, and the libraries we import (say, `csv` or `os`) are a collection of functions."
